      layer2WhyItMatters: `This is THE most important layer for marriage and long-term partnership. Here's why:

• Your mother's emotional patterns shaped how you give and receive love
• This layer determines if you feel "safe" together emotionally
• High scores here mean you intuitively understand each other's needs
• Low scores mean you'll need conscious work to meet each other's emotional needs

Many couples with great surface chemistry struggle because this layer isn't harmonious. Knowing this in advance helps you prepare.`,

      layer2Example: `Ahmad and Layla have great daily chemistry (Fire + Air = 85%).

But when stress hits:
• Ahmad's Water roots (from mother) need emotional processing and talking
• Layla's Fire roots (from mother) need space and action to feel better

Without knowing this, they hurt each other:
• Ahmad feels abandoned when Layla takes space
• Layla feels suffocated when Ahmad wants to talk

WITH this knowledge, they understand: "We're both trying to feel safe×just in different ways."`,
