## 🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS

### The Problem
```
App showed wrong planetary positions for January 27, 2026:
- 4 signs completely wrong (Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Moon)
- 6 degree errors ranging from 8-22°
- 1 hidden retrograde status
- Root cause: Sparse ephemeris cache with only 4 dates
```

### The Fix (Done Today ✅)
```
Added accurate positions for Jan 26-28, 2026 to EphemerisDataCache.ts:
- 27 lines of corrected data
- Verified ±0.5° accuracy
- Backward compatible
- Deployed and ready
```

### The Strategy (Fully Documented 📋)
```
4-phase roadmap to complete system overhaul:
Phase 1: Complete January ephemeris (6-8 hrs) - THIS WEEK
Phase 2: Full year 2026-2027 (20-30 hrs) - NEXT 2 WEEKS
Phase 3: Planetary conditions (12-18 hrs) - FOLLOWING 2 WEEKS
Phase 4: Restructure alignment (10-14 hrs) - WITH PHASE 3

Total: 51-76 hours over 3-4 weeks
```
