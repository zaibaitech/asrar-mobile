```
Asrar offers two privacy modes:

🔒 Guest Mode (Default):

- Maximum privacy

☁️ Account Mode (Optional):
- Cloud backup via Supabase

```

### Data Minimization
```
We collect only what's necessary:

- Location (optional) → For accurate prayer times
- Email (account mode) → For authentication only
```

### User Control
```
Your data, your control:
